## Users can set and modify the daily goal for their calorie intake   
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can set the number of calories they want to consume for the day by clicking the Budget text below the progress bar.  

## Users can add the number of calories burnt for the day  
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can add an estimate of the calories they burn in a day by clicking the Exercise text below the progress bar.  

## Users can see the total amount of calories consumed on a single day  
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can see at a glance the total calories from food numerically and as a graphic progress relative o the goal.  

## Users can see instant progress updates  
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can instantly see graphically and numerically on the progress bar the effect of any changes to the meal entries, the actual exercise calories and the calorie goal.   

## Users can add new entries
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can add new meal entries from a food, drink and meal database by clicking the green plus button at the bottom of their daily log. This launches a screen which allows the user to select a list of food, meals, or drinks. The user is shown a selection of items with images, names and calorie count for each item. The user can then click on the item cards to show a context UI and can add the selected item by clicking the green plus button.    

## Users can modify meal diary entries
This feature is on the meal diary screen. Users can can click on any entry in the meal diary to show a context UI.

<br>

# Packages
## Application
Application classes handle program maintenance through the course of its life cycle

<br>

<h3>Main</h3>
Main handles database and device related maintenance and path handling

<br>

#
## Business
Business classes handle program logic related to their activities.

<br>

<h3>MealDiaryOps</h3>
The meal diary ops class handles logic and operations related to the main app activity; logging users meals. This class handles meal log requests and updates to and from persistence and date manipulation to display the uesr's history for a given date they'd like to view.

<br>

<h3>RecipeBookOps</h3>
The recipe book ops handles logic and operations related to the recipe book and curated recipe functionality. This class handles the retrieval and storage of food, drink, and meal recipeto and from persistence classes.

<br>

<h3>TrendsOps</h3>
The trend ops handles the retrieval of a user's history to create meaningful and informative graphs

<br>

<h3>UserDataOps</h3>
The user data ops handles logic and operations related to the active user.  This class handles the retrieval, storage and updating of a user's personal data. In future updates, it will also detect when vital information is missing thus prompting the user to enter their information.

<br>


#
## Objects  
Object classes represent the meal planner's well defined entities that are known and shared by Business, Presentation, and Persistence.    

<br>

<h3>Edible</h3>
This is the base class at the top of the edible heirarchy that defines essential attributes and functionality all edible items should have.  

<br>

<h3>PreparedEdible</h3>
Inside of the edible hierarchy, below edible, this abstract class defines additional properties and functionality more complex Edibles require.

<br>

<h3>Drink</h3>
Inside of the edible hierarchy, below prepared edible, this class defines essential attributes and functionality for all drinks, with or without ingredients

<br>

<h3>Meal</h3>
Inside of the edible hierarchy, below prepared edible, this class defines essential attributes and functionality for all meals

<br>

<h3>EdibleLog</h3>
Inside of the edible hierarchy, below edible, this class defines essential attributes and functionality for all edibles that appear in the edible log such as maintaining their calories with respect to the original edibles base measurements.

<br>

<h3>DailyLog</h3>
This class defines essential attributes and functionality for each instance of a user's diary history

<br>

<h3>Validator</h3>
Serves as a central source to validates generated values and sanitize user input

<br>

<h3>Ingredient</h3>
This class defines essential attributes and functionality for all edibles that appear as an ingredient in a meal

<br>

<h3>DrinkIngredient</h3>
This class defines essential attributes and functionality for all edibles that appear as an ingredient in a drink. In future updates, this class will be imperative for the redistributing of ingredients when its alcohol contents are modified

<br>

<h3>Constant</h3>
This class is responsible for holding relevant constants throughout the codebase   

<br>

<h3>User</h3>
This class defines essential attributes and functionality for all individual users

<br>

<h3>DataFrame</h3>
This class defines the collection of data requested by the buisness class trendsops. Dataframe provides summary statistics of the data contained within

<br>

<h3>UnitConverter</h3>
This class handles calorie conversions given base measurements of an edible and a seperate set of measurements to convert to.   

<br>

#
## Persistence
Persistence classes interact directly with databases through buisness classes and use well defined interfaces to retrieve and store information.  

<br>

<h3>LogDBInterface</h3>
An interface that defines database operations in relation to the logs and a user's history

<br>

<h3>UserDBInterface</h3>
An interface that defines database operations in relation to its users data

<br>

<h3>RecipeDBInterface</h3>
An interface that defines database operations in relation to recipes

<br>

<h3>DataAccessStub</h3>
This class provides methods that allow the retrieval and storage of data into a in-memory based database (does not persist through restarts).    

<br>

<h3>HSQLDB</h3>
This class provides methods that allow the retrieval and storage of data into a HSQL database (persists through restarts). It is worth mentioning, most tables have a "custom" counterpart.  This will be more relevant in future updates to accomodate a user's desire to add their own recipes and acts as a seperation between the provided curated recipes and the recipes users may add.

<br>

<h3>Selector</h3>
This class provides easy toggleability between the data access stub and HSQL DB using dependency injection (see lines 24 and 25 in DBSelector.java - whichever line is uncommented is the active database and handles all processes)

<br>

#
## Presentation
Presentation classes handle all UI activities. Drawing new elements on the screen, displaying information, accepting user input, handling user gestures, etc.  

<br>

<h3>ActivityMealDiary</h3>
This class handles the UI for the meal diary activity. This is the user interface for logging food consumed. This activity shows a users daily progress at glance and allows the user add their days exercise activity.  

<br>

<h3>ActivityRecipeBook</h3>
This class handles the UI for the recipe book. This is the user interface to view the availible food, meal and drink recipes. In future updates, user's will be able to select one of these recipes to view more in-depth details and add their own custom recipes.

<br>

<h3>ActivityDailyProgress</h3>
This class handles the UI for the daily progress. This is the user interface to view the week's current progress through various scrollable bar charts.

<br>

<h3>ActivityTrends</h3>
This class handles the UI for the user trends. This is the user interface to view the user's progress and history trends through various scrollable graphs over a user selected time span.

<br>

<h3>FragToMealDiary</h3>
This is an interface of methods that allow fragments that comprise the meal diary to send and recieve infromation from the parent activity.    

<br>

<h3>FragToRecipeBook</h3>
This is an interface of methods that allow fragments that comprise the recipe book to send and recieve infromation from the parent activity.  

<br>

<h3>RVAMealDiary</h3>
This is a recycler view adapter for the meal diary activity. This adapter handles the display of different fragment layouts in a recycler view.  

<br>

<h3>RVARecipeBook</h3>
This is a recycler view adapter for the recipe book activity. This adapter handles the display of different fragment layouts in a recycler view.  

<br>

<h3>MealDiaryLiveData</h3>
This is a class that allows the use of the observer design pattern in Android Activities. UI elements can be set to observe this class for changes and allow all observers to update their own elements when this class is updated.  

<br>

<h3>Fragments</h3>
Fragments are reusable UI components that perform specific functions in activities. The most important example is the navigation fragment which is shared across all activities.  

<br>
